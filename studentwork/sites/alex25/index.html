			<p class="info">
				Height: 6' 7" <br>
				Category: <b> Genetic </b> <br>
				Energy Type: Psychic <br> 
				This timeless legendary Pokemon is know far and wide for being the most powerful Pokemon in the game. He was created in a lab by messing around with the DNA of the most OG powerful Pokemon EVER. Mew. This is why he is named MewTWO. He is basically a better freak version of Mew. Mew is still pretty good though...

		<li>
			<a>Charizard</a>
			<img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/006.png">

			<p class="info">
			  Height: 5' 7" <br>
			  Category: <b>Flame</b> <br>
			  Energy Type: <b>Fire</b> <br>
			  This Pokemon is well known worldwide as an awesome Pokemon. Charizard is the face of most pokemon items alongside Pikachu. When a lot of people think of Pokemon, they often think of Pikachu first, then Charizard. Charizard is also known for holding the title of most powerful Pokemon, before Mewtwo came along. He is now one of the best OG pokemons ever. This guy is a legend.
