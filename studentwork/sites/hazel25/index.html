	<h1>TOP 6 BEST SHOWS</h1>

	<p>This is my opinion so these shows might not be the best for you :p</p>

	<ol>
	
		<li>
			<a> Doctor Who </a>
			<img src="https://cdn.europosters.eu/image/750/15894.jpg">

			<p class="info">
				Seasons: 41, Overall<br>
				Genre: <b>Science Fiction, Action, Drama </b> <br>
				Doctor Who is a great show. It's about a time lord who stole a tardis, which is a spaceship, and went to explore. He had to end a war between his people and the daleks leaving the doctor as the last time lord. The doctor gets different companions along the way and changes forms everytime he dies. This is a fun show with lots of amazing adventures. To watch there is a original series, a series in between, and a series on Disney. So far there have been 15 doctors and my personal favorite is David Tennant.

				Genre: <b>Science Fiction, Action </b> <br>
				Star Trek is a great, it had many different shows, Next Generation, Voyager, Deep Space nine, Original series, and many more. It set in the future on starships that explore the universe. It is a great science fiction with many different adventures, and great, loveable characters. Basically every show has fun little "memories" from earlier series. Overall great shows.

			<a> Avatar the Last Airbender</a>
			<img src="https://static0.polygonimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24397267/avatar_generations.jpg">
			<p class="info">
			Seasons: 3 <br>
			Genre: <b> Adventure, Action, Fantasy, Comedy, Animation </b> <br>
			Avatar the Last Airbender is a great show. In this world there are benders of the four elements, air, water, fire, and earth. These benders control the elements that they are part of. For example if you were born in the earth kingdom, you may be a earth bender. However the avatar can control all four elements. But one hundred years ago the avatar disapeared, and the air temples have all been destroyed by the fire nation leader, leaving no air nomands left. One hundred years later Katara, a water bender, and her brother Sokka, a non bender, discover the new avatar named Aang, an airbender. Aang was alive a hundred years ago and he didn't realize his kind was destroyed. Although he was born over a hundred years ago he still looks twelve because he was trapped in a icebrg. Will Aang, Katara, Sokka, Aangs sky bison Appa, and friends they make along the way be able to defeat the fire lord? This is an amazing show with great charcters. Every episode is fun and it is definetly better than I described it! Must watch!
